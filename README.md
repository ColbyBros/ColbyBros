Hi there, I am currently 28 years old living in Chicago!
- I have been in finance for the last 6 years but, am trying to learn how to code to make a career change (bad timing with AI, I know)
- I am currently learning the basics of Python and plan to learn Java, JavaScript, SQL, and C#
- Please feel free to provide any input at any time. I look forward to learning and building!
